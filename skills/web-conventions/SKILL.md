# Web Conventions

Judgment-call conventions for TypeScript/React/SCSS codebases. Mechanically-checkable rules live in the project's ESLint config — the linter is their single source of truth, so they are not repeated here. Project architecture (modules, seams, where things live) is in the project's `AGENTS.md`.

## General principles

- **Reuse before building.** Check the project's existing components, hooks, and utils before writing new ones. When creating something new, shape it to be extendable.
- **Single source of truth.** Store each piece of data — and each *interpretation* of data (e.g. "is this item due soon") — in exactly one place. Logic computed independently in two components will diverge.
- **Explicit over clever.** Prefer a plain `if` block over chained `&&`/`||` expressions used for control flow. Prefer explicit comparisons (`val === undefined`) over truthiness checks that conflate `0`, `""`, and `false` with "missing".
- **Declarative over imperative.** React components instead of DOM manipulation; CSS instead of measuring/drawing in JS; derive state instead of syncing it.

## Topic reference

Consult the matching file when working in that area:

- [typescript.md](typescript.md) — types, nullability, iteration idioms (`.ts`, `.tsx`)
- [react.md](react.md) — component patterns, hooks, state (`.tsx`)
- [css.md](css.md) — SCSS and JSX styling (`.scss`, JSX markup)
- [organization.md](organization.md) — file structure, code layout, comments
